# Defines the column names to be read from the manifest file
# specified in 'paths.feature_manifest'

  # The name of the column in the manifest CSV that contains the
  # relative path to the pre-computed visual feature file (e.g., 'features/visual/scan_001.pt')

  # The list of target labels is read directly from the main
  # config file (training.target_labels). This key confirms
