# configs/model/mlp_visual.yaml
#
# Configures a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) classifier.
# This model uses only visual features as input.

# The _target_ specifies the full Python path to the class to instantiate.
_target_: "ct_rate_benchmarks.models.mlp.MLP"

# Name of this model configuration (metadata, not passed to class)
model_name: "mlp_visual"

# --- NEW: Constructor arguments are nested ---
# These keys MUST match the arguments in MLP.__init__
params:
  # Input feature dimension.
  # This must match the dimensionality of the pre-computed
  # visual embeddings (e.g., 512, 768, 1024).
  # This value is inherited from the linear probe config.
  in_features: 512

  # A list of hidden layer dimensions.
  # This example defines two hidden layers:
  # 1st: 512 -> 256
  # 2nd: 256 -> 128
  hidden_dims: [256, 128]

  # Dropout probability to apply after each hidden layer
  dropout: 0.25

# Note: The 'out_features' (number of labels) is not defined here.
# The training script will add it dynamically based on the
# 'training.target_labels' list from config.yaml.
